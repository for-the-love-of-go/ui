# UI

Package that will be used as a way to easily create GUI's that are loosely based on
html.

## Desired Features:

- Can make ui using calls from go code...
- Can make ui using a markup language
- Uses go to handle actions etc...
- Can easily update things in the ui using variables and it is fast and effiecent.. Not slow
- When changes are made to render only minimal set of changes are made to reduce graphics over head


## Super easy to make:
Buttons
TextBox
Windows
Scrollable Panes
Event handlers per UI Element
All UI elements have id that is easy to reference and figure out
Easy way to disable and enable elements
Real time New Pages....
Easily Style elements as well using properties.. NOT CSS but something that gives similar control.
Markuup for ui will control how elements are made and nested but Style will determine presentation.


## Basic Design:
